## Installation

Get started by installing the PandaAGI SDK using pip:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install panda-agi
```

```bash uv
uv pip install panda-agi
```

```bash poetry
poetry add panda-agi
```

```bash conda
conda install -c conda-forge panda-agi
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key Setup

Before you can start using the SDK, you'll need to configure your API key:

<Warning>
  **Required**: You must obtain an API key from [https://agi.pandas-ai.com/](https://agi.pandas-ai.com/) to use the Panda AGI SDK.
</Warning>

1. Visit [https://agi.pandas-ai.com/](https://agi.pandas-ai.com/) and sign in with GitHub
2. Access your dashboard to get your API key
3. Set the `PANDA_AGI_KEY` environment variable in your .env file or directly in your code

```python
    os.environ['PANDA_AGI_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'
```

You can now use [directly the SDK in your Python scripts](#your-first-interactions), or the pre-built [Chat UI](#pre-built-chat-ui).

## Your First Interactions

The PandaAGI SDK connects you to a pre-configured autonomous general AI agent that already has access to web browsing and file system tools. You simply submit tasks and receive results:

<CodeGroup>

```python Deep Research
import os, asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():

    os.environ['PANDA_AGI_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'

    # Create environment for the general AI agent to work in
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Submit a task and stream results
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Research the latest AI developments and create a summary report",
    ):
        # The general AI agent will:
        # 1. Search multiple sources for recent AI news and developments
        # 2. Analyze and synthesize information from various websites
        # 3. Create a structured report with key findings
        # 4. Save the report as a markdown file in your workspace
        # 5. Include citations and sources for all information

        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")

    
    await agent.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

```python Data Analysis
import os, asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import LocalEnv

async def main():

    os.environ['PANDA_AGI_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'

    # Use local environment for file operations
    agent_env = LocalEnv("./my_workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # General AI agent can read, write, and analyze files
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Analyze the data in sales.csv and create a visualization report"
    ):
        # The general AI agent will:
        # 1. Read and parse the sales.csv file
        # 2. Perform statistical analysis on the data
        # 3. Identify trends, patterns, and insights
        # 4. Generate charts and visualizations
        # 5. Create an HTML report with interactive graphs
        # 6. Provide actionable recommendations based on findings

        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")

    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

```python Market Research
import os, asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():
    os.environ['PANDA_AGI_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'
    
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Research the electric vehicle market and create a comprehensive report"
    ):
        # The general AI agent will:
        # 1. Gather data from industry reports, news sources, and market analyses
        # 2. Compile information on market size, key players, and growth trends
        # 3. Create forecasts and investment opportunity analysis
        # 4. Generate a complete 50-page professional report with visualizations
        # 5. Include executive summary and strategic recommendations
        
        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")
        
    await agent.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

```python System Design
import os, asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import LocalEnv

async def main():
    os.environ['PANDA_AGI_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'
    
    agent_env = LocalEnv("./my_workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Design a database schema for an e-commerce platform"
    ):
        # The general AI agent will:
        # 1. Create entity-relationship diagrams for the entire platform
        # 2. Generate SQL scripts for database creation and sample data
        # 3. Document data flows and relationships between entities
        # 4. Provide scalability considerations and optimization strategies
        # 5. Include implementation guidelines and best practices
        
        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")
        
    await agent.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

```python Technical Documentation
import os, asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():
    os.environ['PANDA_AGI_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'
    
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Create user documentation for our REST API with examples"
    ):
        # The general AI agent will:
        # 1. Analyze your API structure and endpoints
        # 2. Create comprehensive documentation with clear descriptions
        # 3. Generate request/response examples for each endpoint
        # 4. Include authentication guides and error handling
        # 5. Provide SDK examples in multiple programming languages
        # 6. Structure everything in a developer-friendly format
        
        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")
        
    await agent.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Pre-built Chat UI

You can also use the pre-built chat UI to interact with the general AI agent.

What do you need?
- Docker up and running (either install [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)) or [set it up via code](installation#docker-setup))
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- [PANDA_AGI_KEY](https://agi.pandas-ai.com/) environment variable set in the .env file
- [TAVILY_API_KEY](https://tavily.ai/) environment variable set in the .env file

Clone the panda-agi repo, move to the ui folder and simply execute the start.sh script:

```bash
cd examples/ui && ./start.sh
```

This one command will:
- ‚úÖ Check Docker requirements  
- üõë Stop any existing containers
- üî® Build and start both services
- üîç Perform health checks
- üìä Display service status and URLs

Once running, access:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8001

This is the fastest way to get started with a production-ready agentic chat interface using the PandaAGI SDK.

## Next Steps

That's it! You're now ready to submit tasks to the autonomous general AI agent and receive professional-grade results. The general AI agent handles all the complexity of web research, file operations, and task execution automatically.
