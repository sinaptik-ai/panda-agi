## Installation

Get started by installing the PandaAGI SDK using pip:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install panda-agi
```

```bash uv
uv pip install panda-agi
```

```bash poetry
poetry add panda-agi
```

```bash conda
conda install -c conda-forge panda-agi
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key Setup

Before you can start using the SDK, you'll need to configure your API key:

<Warning>
  **Required**: You must obtain an API key from [https://agi.pandas-ai.com/](https://agi.pandas-ai.com/) to use the Panda AGI SDK.
</Warning>

1. Visit [https://agi.pandas-ai.com/](https://agi.pandas-ai.com/) and sign in with GitHub
2. Access your dashboard to get your API key
3. Set the `PANDA_AGI_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export PANDA_AGI_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

<Info>
  For detailed setup instructions including platform-specific configuration, see the [Installation Guide](/installation#api-key-configuration).
</Info>

## Your First Interaction

The PandaAGI SDK connects you to a pre-configured autonomous general AI agent that already has access to web browsing and file system tools. You simply submit tasks and receive results:

<CodeGroup>

```python Deep Research
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():
    # Create environment for the general AI agent to work in
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Submit a task and stream results
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Research the latest AI developments and create a summary report",
    ):
        # The general AI agent will:
        # 1. Search multiple sources for recent AI news and developments
        # 2. Analyze and synthesize information from various websites
        # 3. Create a structured report with key findings
        # 4. Save the report as a markdown file in your workspace
        # 5. Include citations and sources for all information

        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")

    
    await agent.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

```python Data Analysis
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import LocalEnv

async def main():
    # Use local environment for file operations
    agent_env = LocalEnv("./my_workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # General AI agent can read, write, and analyze files
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Analyze the data in sales.csv and create a visualization report"
    ):
        # The general AI agent will:
        # 1. Read and parse the sales.csv file
        # 2. Perform statistical analysis on the data
        # 3. Identify trends, patterns, and insights
        # 4. Generate charts and visualizations
        # 5. Create an HTML report with interactive graphs
        # 6. Provide actionable recommendations based on findings

        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")

    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example Tasks

## Real-time Event Streaming

Monitor your general AI agent's progress in real-time as it works through complex tasks. Events are streamed asynchronously from the remote general AI agent as they occur, providing detailed insight into the general AI agent's workflow:

```python
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent, EventType
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Stream events to see what the general AI agent is doing in real-time
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Research the latest AI developments and create a summary report"
    ):
        # Events are generated asynchronously by the remote agent
        # You'll see the actual workflow unfold step by step:
        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type.value}: {event.data}")
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Real Event Stream Example

Here's what you'll actually see when running the above code - events stream live as the agent works:

```bash

```

### Event-Driven UI Updates

Build responsive interfaces that update as the general AI agent works:

```python
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent, EventType
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

class AgentMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.status = "Idle"
        self.current_task = None
        self.files_created = []
        self.search_queries = []
    
    async def run_with_monitoring(self, query):
        agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
        agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
        
        try:
            async for event in agent.run(query):
                await self.handle_event(event)
        finally:
            await agent.disconnect()
    
    async def handle_event(self, event):
        """Process events as they stream from the remote general AI agent"""
        
        if event.type == EventType.AGENT_CONNECTION_SUCCESS:
            self.status = "Connected - Workspace initialized"
            print(f"üîó {self.status}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.WEB_SEARCH:
            query = event.data.get('query', '')
            self.search_queries.append(query)
            self.status = f"üîç Searching: {query}"
            print(f"üîç Web search: {query}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.WEB_NAVIGATION:
            url = event.data.get('url', '')
            self.status = f"üåê Reading: {url}"
            print(f"üåê Navigating to: {url}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.FILE_WRITE:
            filename = event.data.get('file', '')
            self.files_created.append(filename)
            self.status = f"üìù Created: {filename}"
            print(f"üìù File created: {filename}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.SHELL_EXEC:
            command = event.data.get('command', '')
            self.status = f"‚öôÔ∏è Running: {command}"
            print(f"‚öôÔ∏è Executing: {command}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.USER_NOTIFICATION:
            message = event.data.get('text', '')
            attachments = event.data.get('attachments', [])
            self.status = "‚úÖ Task update available"
            print(f"üì¢ Update: {message}")
            if attachments:
                print(f"üìé Files: {', '.join(attachments)}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.COMPLETED_TASK:
            self.status = "‚úÖ Task completed"
            print(f"üéâ Task completed!")
            print(f"üìä Summary:")
            print(f"  - Files created: {len(self.files_created)}")
            print(f"  - Web searches: {len(self.search_queries)}")

# Usage
async def main():
    monitor = AgentMonitor()
    await monitor.run_with_monitoring(
        "Research quantum computing trends and create a technical report"
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

The event streaming system provides complete transparency into the general AI agent's autonomous workflow, allowing you to build sophisticated monitoring, progress tracking, and user interface systems around the general AI agent's real-time activity.

## Environment Options

Choose where the general AI agent operates based on your security and isolation needs:

```python
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv, LocalEnv

async def main():
    # Option 1: Isolated Docker environment (recommended)
    docker_env = DockerEnv("./secure_workspace")
    
    # Option 2: Local environment (direct file system access)
    local_env = LocalEnv("./local_workspace")
    
    # Choose your environment
    agent = Agent(environment=docker_env)
    
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Build a website prototype with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
    ):
        print(f"[EVENT]: {event}")
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Next Steps

That's it! You're now ready to submit tasks to the autonomous general AI agent and receive professional-grade results. The general AI agent handles all the complexity of web research, file operations, and task execution automatically.
