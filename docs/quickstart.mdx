## Installation

Get started by installing the PandaAGI SDK using pip:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install panda-agi
```

```bash uv
uv pip install panda-agi
```

```bash poetry
poetry add panda-agi
```

```bash conda
conda install -c conda-forge panda-agi
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key Setup

Before you can start using the SDK, you'll need to configure your API key:

<Warning>
  **Required**: You must obtain an API key from [https://agi.pandas-ai.com/](https://agi.pandas-ai.com/) to use the Panda AGI SDK.
</Warning>

1. Visit [https://agi.pandas-ai.com/](https://agi.pandas-ai.com/) and sign in with GitHub
2. Access your dashboard to get your API key
3. Set the `PANDA_AGI_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export PANDA_AGI_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

<Info>
  For detailed setup instructions including platform-specific configuration, see the [Installation Guide](/installation#api-key-configuration).

## Your First Interaction

The PandaAGI SDK connects you to a pre-configured autonomous agent that already has access to web browsing and file system tools. You simply submit tasks and receive results:

<CodeGroup>

```python Deep Research
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():
    # Create environment for the agent to work in
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Submit a task and stream results
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Research the latest AI developments and create a summary report",
    ):
        # The agent will:
        # 1. Search multiple sources for recent AI news and developments
        # 2. Analyze and synthesize information from various websites
        # 3. Create a structured report with key findings
        # 4. Save the report as a markdown file in your workspace
        # 5. Include citations and sources for all information

        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")

    
    await agent.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

```python Data Analysis
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import LocalEnv

async def main():
    # Use local environment for file operations
    agent_env = LocalEnv("./my_workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Agent can read, write, and analyze files
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Analyze the data in sales.csv and create a visualization report"
    ):
        # The agent will:
        # 1. Read and parse the sales.csv file
        # 2. Perform statistical analysis on the data
        # 3. Identify trends, patterns, and insights
        # 4. Generate charts and visualizations
        # 5. Create an HTML report with interactive graphs
        # 6. Provide actionable recommendations based on findings

        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")

    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example Tasks

## Real-time Event Streaming

Monitor your agent's progress in real-time as it works through complex tasks. Events are streamed asynchronously from the remote agent as they occur, providing detailed insight into the agent's workflow:

```python
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent, EventType
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Stream events to see what the agent is doing in real-time
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Research the latest AI developments and create a summary report"
    ):
        # Events are generated asynchronously by the remote agent
        # You'll see the actual workflow unfold step by step:
        print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type.value}: {event.data}")
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Real Event Stream Example

Here's what you'll actually see when running the above code - events stream live as the agent works:

```bash

### Event-Driven UI Updates

Build responsive interfaces that update as the agent works:

```python
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent, EventType
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

class AgentMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.status = "Idle"
        self.current_task = None
        self.files_created = []
        self.search_queries = []
    
    async def run_with_monitoring(self, query):
        agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
        agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
        
        try:
            async for event in agent.run(query):
                await self.handle_event(event)
        finally:
            await agent.disconnect()
    
    async def handle_event(self, event):
        """Process events as they stream from the remote agent"""
        
        if event.type == EventType.AGENT_CONNECTION_SUCCESS:
            self.status = "Connected - Workspace initialized"
            print(f"🔗 {self.status}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.WEB_SEARCH:
            query = event.data.get('query', '')
            self.search_queries.append(query)
            self.status = f"🔍 Searching: {query}"
            print(f"🔍 Web search: {query}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.WEB_NAVIGATION:
            url = event.data.get('url', '')
            self.status = f"🌐 Reading: {url}"
            print(f"🌐 Navigating to: {url}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.FILE_WRITE:
            filename = event.data.get('file', '')
            self.files_created.append(filename)
            self.status = f"📝 Created: {filename}"
            print(f"📝 File created: {filename}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.SHELL_EXEC:
            command = event.data.get('command', '')
            self.status = f"⚙️ Running: {command}"
            print(f"⚙️ Executing: {command}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.USER_NOTIFICATION:
            message = event.data.get('text', '')
            attachments = event.data.get('attachments', [])
            self.status = "✅ Task update available"
            print(f"📢 Update: {message}")
            if attachments:
                print(f"📎 Files: {', '.join(attachments)}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.COMPLETED_TASK:
            self.status = "✅ Task completed"
            print(f"🎉 Task completed!")
            print(f"📊 Summary:")
            print(f"  - Files created: {len(self.files_created)}")
            print(f"  - Web searches: {len(self.search_queries)}")

# Usage
async def main():
    monitor = AgentMonitor()
    await monitor.run_with_monitoring(
        "Research quantum computing trends and create a technical report"
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

The event streaming system provides complete transparency into the agent's autonomous workflow, allowing you to build sophisticated monitoring, progress tracking, and user interface systems around the agent's real-time activity.

## Environment Options

Choose where the agent operates based on your security and isolation needs:

```python
import asyncio
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv, LocalEnv

async def main():
    # Option 1: Isolated Docker environment (recommended)
    docker_env = DockerEnv("./secure_workspace")
    
    # Option 2: Local environment (direct file system access)
    local_env = LocalEnv("./local_workspace")
    
    # Choose your environment
    agent = Agent(environment=docker_env)
    
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Build a website prototype with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
    ):
        print(f"[EVENT]: {event}")
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```
