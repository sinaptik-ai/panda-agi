## What are Events?

Events are real-time notifications streamed asynchronously from the remote autonomous general AI agent as it executes tasks. They provide complete transparency into the general AI agent's workflow, allowing you to monitor progress, debug issues, and build interactive applications that respond to the general AI agent's activities in real-time.

Unlike traditional polling-based systems, PandaAGI events are pushed from the remote agent immediately as they occur, ensuring minimal latency and maximum responsiveness.

## Event Architecture

The PandaAGI SDK streams events from a remote autonomous general AI agent that operates independently. Events are generated as the general AI agent:

- Connects to its execution environment
- Performs web searches and navigation
- Creates, reads, and modifies files
- Executes shell commands and scripts
- Provides progress updates and notifications
- Completes tasks and reports results

```python
# Events stream asynchronously from the remote general AI agent
async for event in agent.run("Research AI trends and create a report"):
    # Each event represents a real action the general AI agent is taking
    print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")
```

## Core Event Types

The Panda AGI SDK uses a comprehensive set of event types defined in the `EventType` enum. Here are all available event types:

## Event Streaming

### Basic Streaming with Type Safety

Stream events in real-time as your remote general AI agent works through complex tasks:

```python
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv
from panda_agi.client.models import (
    # Type guard functions for type safety
    is_agent_connection_success_event,
    is_web_search_event,
    is_web_navigation_event,
    is_file_write_event,
    is_shell_exec_event,
    is_user_notification_event,
    is_completed_task_event,
)
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Initialize the remote general AI agent environment
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)

    # Stream events as the general AI agent works autonomously
    async for event in agent.run("Research machine learning trends and create a comprehensive report"):
        # Type checker knows exactly what type each event is!
        
        if is_agent_connection_success_event(event):
            # Type checker knows event is AgentConnectionSuccessEvent here
            file_system = event.data.get("file_system", {})
            directory = file_system.get("directory", "unknown")
            print(f"🔗 Agent connected: {directory}")
        
        elif is_web_search_event(event):
            # Type checker knows event is WebSearchEvent here
            query = event.data.get("query", "")
            print(f"🔍 Searching: {query}")
        
        elif is_web_navigation_event(event):
            # Type checker knows event is WebNavigationEvent here
            url = event.data.get("url", "")
            print(f"🌐 Reading: {url}")
        
        elif is_file_write_event(event):
            # Type checker knows event is FileWriteEvent here
            filename = event.data.get("file", "")
            print(f"📝 Created: {filename}")
        
        elif is_shell_exec_event(event):
            # Type checker knows event is ShellExecEvent here
            command = event.data.get("command", "")
            print(f"⚙️ Executing: {command}")
        
        elif is_user_notification_event(event):
            # Type checker knows event is UserNotificationEvent here
            text = event.data.get("text", "")
            attachments = event.data.get("attachments", [])
            print(f"📢 Update: {text}")
            if attachments:
                print(f"📎 Files: {', '.join(attachments)}")
        
        elif is_completed_task_event(event):
            # Type checker knows event is CompletedTaskEvent here
            print("🎉 Task completed!")
            break
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Advanced Event Handling with Typed Models

```python
from panda_agi import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv
from panda_agi.client.models import (
    StreamEvent,
    # Import specific event types
    WebSearchEvent,
    FileWriteEvent,
    UserNotificationEvent,
    # Type guards
    is_web_search_event,
    is_file_write_event,
    is_user_notification_event,
    is_shell_exec_event,
    is_image_generation_event,
    is_completed_task_event,
)
import asyncio

async def advanced_event_monitoring():
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Track different categories of activities with type safety
    async for event in agent.run("Analyze codebase and generate documentation"):
        
        # Web activities
        if is_web_search_event(event):
            query = event.data.get("query", "")
            max_results = event.data.get("max_results", 0)
            print(f"🌐 Web search: '{query}' (max {max_results} results)")
            
        # File activities  
        elif is_file_write_event(event):
            filename = event.data.get("file", "")
            content_length = len(event.data.get("content", ""))
            append_mode = event.data.get("append", False)
            mode = "appended to" if append_mode else "created"
            print(f"📁 File {mode}: {filename} ({content_length} chars)")
            
        # Shell activities
        elif is_shell_exec_event(event):
            command = event.data.get("command", "")
            exec_dir = event.data.get("exec_dir", "")
            print(f"💻 Shell: {command} (in {exec_dir})")
            
        # Creative activities
        elif is_image_generation_event(event):
            prompt = event.data.get("prompt", "")
            image_path = event.data.get("image_path", "")
            print(f"🎨 Generated: {image_path} from '{prompt}'")
            
        # Communication
        elif is_user_notification_event(event):
            text = event.data.get("text", "")
            print(f"📢 Progress: {text}")
            
        elif is_completed_task_event(event):
            print("✅ Task completed!")
            break
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(advanced_event_monitoring())
```

### Creating Events Programmatically

You can also create typed events programmatically for testing or custom workflows:

```python
from panda_agi.client.models import (
    UserNotificationEvent,
    FileWriteEvent,
    WebSearchEvent,
    StreamEvent,
)

# Create a typed notification event
notification = UserNotificationEvent(
    data={
        "text": "Analysis complete!",
        "attachments": ["report.md", "charts.png"]
    }
)

# Create a typed file event
file_event = FileWriteEvent(
    data={
        "file": "analysis.md",
        "content": "# Analysis Results\n\nFindings...",
        "append": False
    }
)

# Events are fully typed and can be used in unions
events: list[StreamEvent] = [notification, file_event]

# Type-safe event processing
for event in events:
    if is_user_notification_event(event):
        print(f"Notification: {event.data['text']}")
    elif is_file_write_event(event):
        print(f"File written: {event.data['file']}")
```
