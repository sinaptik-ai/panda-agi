## What are Events?

Events are real-time notifications streamed asynchronously from the remote autonomous agent as it executes tasks. They provide complete transparency into the agent's workflow, allowing you to monitor progress, debug issues, and build interactive applications that respond to the agent's activities in real-time.

Unlike traditional polling-based systems, PandaAGI events are pushed from the remote agent immediately as they occur, ensuring minimal latency and maximum responsiveness.

## Event Architecture

The PandaAGI SDK streams events from a remote autonomous agent that operates independently. Events are generated as the agent:

- Connects to its execution environment
- Performs web searches and navigation
- Creates, reads, and modifies files
- Executes shell commands and scripts
- Provides progress updates and notifications
- Completes tasks and reports results

```python
# Events stream asynchronously from the remote agent
async for event in agent.run("Research AI trends and create a report"):
    # Each event represents a real action the agent is taking
    print(f"[{event.timestamp}] {event.type}: {event.data}")
```

## Core Event Types

The Panda AGI SDK uses a comprehensive set of event types defined in the `EventType` enum. Here are all available event types:

```

## Event Streaming

### Basic Streaming

Stream events in real-time as your remote agent works through complex tasks:

```python
from panda_agi import Agent, EventType
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Initialize the remote agent environment
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)

    # Stream events as the agent works autonomously
    async for event in agent.run("Research machine learning trends and create a comprehensive report"):
        # Events stream live from the remote agent
        if event.type == EventType.AGENT_CONNECTION_SUCCESS:
            print(f"🔗 Agent connected: {event.data['file_system']['directory']}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.WEB_SEARCH:
            print(f"🔍 Searching: {event.data['query']}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.WEB_NAVIGATION:
            print(f"🌐 Reading: {event.data['url']}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.FILE_WRITE:
            print(f"📝 Created: {event.data['file']}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.SHELL_EXEC:
            print(f"⚙️ Executing: {event.data['command']}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.USER_NOTIFICATION:
            print(f"📢 Update: {event.data['text']}")
            if event.data.get('attachments'):
                print(f"📎 Files: {', '.join(event.data['attachments'])}")
        
        elif event.type == EventType.COMPLETED_TASK:
            print("🎉 Task completed!")
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```


### Advanced Event Handling with Enums

```python
from panda_agi import Agent, EventType
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv
import asyncio

async def advanced_event_monitoring():
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Track different types of activities
    web_activities = [EventType.WEB_SEARCH, EventType.WEB_NAVIGATION]
    file_activities = [EventType.FILE_READ, EventType.FILE_WRITE, EventType.FILE_REPLACE, EventType.FILE_EXPLORE]
    shell_activities = [EventType.SHELL_EXEC, EventType.SHELL_VIEW, EventType.SHELL_WRITE]
    
    async for event in agent.run("Analyze codebase and generate documentation"):
        if event.type in web_activities:
            print(f"🌐 Web activity: {event.type.value}")
        elif event.type in file_activities:
            print(f"📁 File activity: {event.type.value}")
        elif event.type in shell_activities:
            print(f"💻 Shell activity: {event.type.value}")
        elif event.type == EventType.IMAGE_GENERATION:
            print(f"🎨 Generated image: {event.data.get('image_path', 'unknown')}")
        elif event.type == EventType.USER_QUESTION:
            print(f"❓ Agent question: {event.data['question']}")
        elif event.type == EventType.USER_NOTIFICATION:
            print(f"📢 Progress update: {event.data['text']}")
        elif event.type == EventType.COMPLETED_TASK:
            print("✅ Task completed successfully!")
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(advanced_event_monitoring())
```
