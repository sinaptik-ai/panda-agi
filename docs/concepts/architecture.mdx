## PandaAGI Architecture Diagram

**PandaAGI** is a fully agentic execution ecosystem built for developers who want AI that **does** things, not just generates content. The system consists of **three core components**: the [API](#the-pandaagi-api), the [SDK](#the-pandaagi-sdk), and the [execution environments](#the-execution-environments).

The architecture features:
- **Specialized general AI agent orchestration**: Tasks routed to dedicated [general AI agents](/concepts/agents) optimized for specific roles
- **Structured parallelism**: Tasks broken into subtasks that execute independently then merge
- **Resilience and recovery**: Automatic retries and reassignment for robust execution
- **Event-driven communication**: Real-time [events](/concepts/events) for monitoring and response

The framework implements **separation of concerns** with three distinct layers:
- **AI Layer**: Task understanding, planning, and orchestration of tool execution
- **Tool Layer**: Specific operations in the local environment (file operations, API calls)
- **Application Layer**: User experience and business logic development

## The PandaAGI API

A **bidirectional WebSocket API** built for real-time, stateful interaction. Unlike traditional REST APIs, the PandaAGI API keeps a live connection between your application and your agent‚Äîenabling streaming execution, dynamic state management, and continuous interaction. Use it to send tasks, receive results, and monitor execution in-flight.

## The PandaAGI SDK

We don't believe developers should spend their time wiring sockets, managing general AI agent state, or reinventing orchestration logic. The PandaAGI SDK exists to shift that burden away from you. It sets up secure, persistent socket connections so [general AI agents](/concepts/agents) can remain stateful across tasks. It keeps track of tools, and context‚Äîso general AI agents can reason, act, and adapt without manual glue code, so you can focus on logic, outcomes, and systems that learn and improve.

The PandaAGI SDK allows you to build and deploy extremely powerful general AI agents virtually capable of doing anything thanks to the in-built execution capabilities that comes with every PandaAGI general AI agent:

| Capability | Purpose |
|:--- |:--- |
| üåê Internet access | Information gathering |
| üóÇÔ∏è File system | Asset management |
| üíª Code execution | Dynamic programming |
| üöÄ Deployment | Web servers & APIs |

All general AI agent activities generate real-time [events](/concepts/events) that you can subscribe to for monitoring progress, collecting results, and responding to state changes.

The general AI agents generate real-time events in their own execution environment. 

## The Execution Environments

[General AI agents](/concepts/agents) that reason need a place to act. 
The [execution environment](/concepts/environments) is that space: a clean, isolated context where general AI agents can safely write and run code, store state, interact with external systems, and build a mental model of their task. 
Each environment is ephemeral, containerized, and independent‚Äîcreated for a single user or session. 

It's not just a sandbox; it's an operating layer for autonomous behavior. 
It can run on the cloud, on your own hardware, or across both. 

What matters is that execution is local to the general AI agent‚Äîself-contained, inspectable, and secure.
