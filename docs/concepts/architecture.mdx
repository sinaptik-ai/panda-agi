## PandaAGI Architecture Overview

<Note>
**PandaAGI** is a fully agentic execution ecosystem built for developers who want AI that **does** things, not just generates content. The system consists of **three core components**: the API, the SDK, and the execution environments.

## The PandaAGI API

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Overview">
    <Note>
      A **bidirectional WebSocket API** built for real-time, stateful interaction with your agents.
    </Note>
    
    Unlike traditional REST APIs, the PandaAGI API keeps a live connection between your application and your agent—enabling:

## The PandaAGI SDK

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Overview">
    <Note>
      We don't believe developers should spend their time wiring sockets, managing agent state, or reinventing orchestration logic. The PandaAGI SDK exists to shift that burden away from you.
    </Note>
    
    The SDK handles the complex infrastructure so you can focus on building powerful applications:
    
    - Sets up secure, persistent socket connections
    - Manages agent state across tasks
    - Tracks tools and context
    - Enables agents to reason, act, and adapt without manual glue code
