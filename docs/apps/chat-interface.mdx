## How to build your own Agentic AI Assistant?

Create your own version of powerful AI assistants (similar to Claude Opus, Manus AI, 
Perplexity, Devin, or ChatGPT with plugins) - all using PandaAGI's SDK.

  alt="Chat Interface"
/>

This example app demonstrates how to build a modern agentic chat with an interface that streams responses in real-time, showing agent thinking, tool usage, and providing a smooth user experience.

## Ready-to-use Agentic AI Assistant

A complete, enhanced agentic chat with an interface implementation is already available in the examples folder! You can get started immediately with our Docker-based setup.

The implemented solution includes:

- **Docker Integration**: One-command deployment with Docker Compose
- **Enhanced Event Handling**: Improved event filtering and error handling
- **Production Ready**: Nginx serving, proper CORS, health checks
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

### Quick Setup

What do you need?
- Docker up and running (either install [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)) or [set it up via code](installation#docker-setup))
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- [PANDA_AGI_KEY](https://agi.pandas-ai.com/) environment variable set in the .env file
- [TAVILY_API_KEY](https://tavily.ai/) environment variable set in the .env file

Clone the panda-agi repo, move to the ui folder and simply execute the start.sh script:

```bash
cd examples/ui && ./start.sh
```

This one command will:
- ‚úÖ Check Docker requirements  
- üõë Stop any existing containers
- üî® Build and start both services
- üîç Perform health checks
- üìä Display service status and URLs

Once running, access:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8001

This is the fastest way to get started with a production-ready agentic chat interface using the PandaAGI SDK.


### Alternative Setup

If you prefer manual setup or local development:

```bash
# Backend
cd examples/ui/backend && python main.py

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd examples/ui/frontend && npm start
```

Congrats. Now you have your own production-ready agentic chat interface!
