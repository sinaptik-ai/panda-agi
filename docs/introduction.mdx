## What is AGI?

AGI traditionally means **Artificial General Intelligence** ‚Äî the theoretical ability of AI to match human intelligence across all tasks. At PandasAI, we redefine it as **Agentic General Intelligence**: AI that accomplishes tasks through tools rather than mimicking human thought.

## What is PandaAGI SDK?

We developed the PandaAGI SDK to enable **agentic AI** in your applications. The PandaAGI SDK is a powerful development framework that lets you:

- **Build AI applications** using autonomous general AI agents
- Create custom AI-integrated experiences tailored to your specific needs
- Let the SDK handle complex AI orchestration behind the scenes

Think of it as the foundation for building your own AI development platform ‚Äî with the flexibility to create exactly what your users need, while maintaining **full control** over the experience and execution environment.

## Who is PandaAGI for?

PandaAGI is purpose-built for software engineers, product engineers and exceptional developers who:
- Want to build custom AI tools rather than use generic platforms
- Need flexible solutions that integrate with existing systems
- Prefer local control over their data and execution environment

If you write code and want to leverage AI's power while maintaining control over implementation, PandaAGI provides the framework you need.

## What can you do with PandaAGI?

PandaAGI empowers you to build the next billion-dollar AI product. Create the next Cursor, Lovable, or entirely new category of AI-powered application with complete control over the user experience.

Key use cases include:
- **Development Tools**: AI coding assistants and workflow automation
- **Business Intelligence**: Research platforms and competitive analysis
- **Content Systems**: Automated documentation and content generation
- **Enterprise Solutions**: Custom AI tools tailored to specific business needs

## How does PandaAGI work?

PandaAGI is built on three core components:

1. **The API**: A bidirectional WebSocket connection for real-time, stateful interaction between your application and agents

2. **The SDK**: Handles socket connections, agent state, and orchestration so you can focus on building your application

3. **The Execution Environment**: A secure, isolated context where agents can safely run code and interact with external systems

The PandaAGI SDK allows you to build and deploy extremely powerful agents virtually capable of doing anything thanks to the in-built execution capabilities that comes with every PandaAGI agent:

| Capability | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| üåê **Internet access** | Information gathering |
| üóÇÔ∏è **File system** | Asset management |
| üíª **Code execution** | Dynamic programming |
| üöÄ **Deployment** | Web servers & APIs |
